MODULAR PROGRAMMING 
In MODULAR PROGRAMMING(Collection of Function) we develop program in function.
e.g. Bank system
openacc()
{
    deposit()
    withdraw()
    checkbal()
    applyloan()
}

In Object Oriented PROGRAMMING - Collection of Object. Every Object has its collection offuction.
OOP is suitable best for Large size project.

**********PRINCIPLES OF OBJECT ORIENTATION****************************
1. ABSTRACTION - To hide internal details about How it works from user. e.g printf() function
2. ENCAPSULATION-To avoid system from mishandling ENCAPSULATION is required.
                 We hide the Data and show the function (Data Hiding)
3. INHERITANCE
4. POLYMORPHISM
